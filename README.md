# Flow1Week1

Michael N. K.


Overall note: All assignments that required cloning of a reporsitory was not followed, but created manually, as the clones encountered many bugs with Netbeans.




01-tuesday-exercises:

These exercises covers the JPA part of the weekly progress, with focus on entity classes and transactions.

I did not commit what was made from the assignment document 'Fundamental JPA and Facades Guideline', as instructed by the teacher.
All assignments completed in the other document, including tests.
System-errors for Netbeans 11 was encountered, and tests had to be made with a manual setup in each method.
Multiple names was changed from the assignment

This project was also affected by assignments from wednesday, and is as such only including REST aspects from the week.

The CustomerFacade class was the EntityTested class, but was refactored during the assignment.




02-wednesday-exercises:

These exercises covers the use of REST from the weekly progress, with use of Json formatting.

All of the exercises steps was compleded, with a bit of confusion from the tutorial. All parts of the exercises should be able to be found in classes with logical names.




03-thursday-exercises:

These exercives covers the weeks focus on JPA with Web service.

All assignments were completed, and all results were as expected, including the droplets inability to connect to use the war, given the vagrant database cannot be reached.




04-friday-exercises:

These are the friday exercises, and do not introduce new elements, but rather combines the REST and JPA subjects.

All exercises parts have been completed, and names match the required names for the exercise.
